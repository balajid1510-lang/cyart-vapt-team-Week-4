Checklist for documentation:

Enumerate all endpoints tested.

Describe testing approach for each vulnerability.

Include screenshots of Burp Suite / Postman where vulnerabilities were found.

Summarize vulnerabilities with:

Severity (Critical / High)

Affected endpoint

How the vulnerability can be exploited

Provide remediation advice:

BOLA → Implement proper access control checks

GraphQL → Sanitize inputs, validate query depth, and use query whitelisting

Example Summary (50 words):

Tested DVWA APIs for OWASP API Top 10 vulnerabilities. Discovered critical BOLA on /api/users allowing unauthorized access to other user data. High-risk GraphQL injection found on /graphql permitting data exposure. Manual testing with Burp Suite and Postman confirmed the issues, highlighting the need for strict access control and input validation.
