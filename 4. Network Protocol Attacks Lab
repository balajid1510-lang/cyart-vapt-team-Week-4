Network Protocol Attacks Lab â€“ TryHackMe VM

Tools: Responder, Ettercap, Wireshark
Scope: Perform network protocol attacks, capture credentials, and analyze traffic

Attack Log
Attack ID	Technique	Target IP	Status	Outcome
015	SMB Relay	192.168.1.200	Success	NTLM Hash
Practical Steps Documented

1. SMB Relay Attack with Responder:

Launched Responder to poison LLMNR/NBT-NS requests on the network.

Captured NTLM authentication hashes from the target during SMB requests.

Successfully intercepted hashes which could be used for offline cracking.

2. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack with Ettercap:

Conducted ARP spoofing to position as a MitM between target and gateway.

Intercepted traffic, including credentials and session tokens, for analysis.

3. Traffic Analysis with Wireshark:

Captured packets from the network during the MitM session.

Filtered for SMB, HTTP, and DNS traffic to identify sensitive data leaks.

Checklist for Lab Report

Capture NTLM hashes using Responder and document captured credentials.

Perform ARP spoofing with Ettercap to intercept traffic.

Analyze intercepted traffic with Wireshark to find unencrypted information.

Note all commands and outcomes, including screenshots of captured hashes and traffic.

Summary (50 words)

Executed a network protocol attack on a TryHackMe VM. Used Responder to perform an SMB relay attack and captured NTLM hashes. Conducted ARP spoofing with Ettercap for a MitM attack and intercepted network traffic. Analyzed packets in Wireshark, demonstrating protocol vulnerabilities and credential exposure in an unprotected network environment.
